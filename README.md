When developing a Laravel application on your local machine, you need to run both `npm run dev` and `php artisan serve` to get the full development experience.

`npm run dev` compiles your JavaScript assets and watches for changes, automatically recompiling and reloading the assets as needed. This ensures that you always see the latest changes to your JavaScript code without having to manually restart the server.

`php artisan serve` starts a local development server that serves your Laravel application. This allows you to access your application in a web browser without having to deploy it to a production server.
